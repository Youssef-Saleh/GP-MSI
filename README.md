# Machine Learning and Mass Spectrometry Imaging: Application in Tumor Heterogeneity

Identification of tumor subpopulations that detriments the disease prognosis and the patient outcomes is essential for personalized therapy. Studies showed that Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) showed capability in visualizing intratumor heterogeneity and helped in identifying diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Our goal was to understand and study the methods introduced by Abdelmoula et al. in “Data-driven identification of prognostic tumor subpopulations using spatially mapped t-SNE of mass spectrometry imaging data” and use as reference for our work. In our project, we implemented a pythonic-approach to our work reference. We used machine learning techniques and statistical methods to identify the significant tumor subpopulations that affect the patient status. Dimensionality reduction was performed using spatially mapped t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and K-means clustering was applied to discretize the data. Statistical analysis is done on the discretized data to deduce the significant clusters; hazardous cluster in Gastric cancer data and metastatic cluster in Breast cancer data. Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM) was used to reveal the statistically significant protein ions with FDR < 0.0001 associated with these significant clusters. We built a predictive model using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict the survival status of Gastric cancer patients and the metastatic status of Breast cancer patients.
